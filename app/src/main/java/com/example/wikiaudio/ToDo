TODO:
(1) Regarding the wikipages that appear on the playlist fragment:
    (a) Highlight the wikipage that is being played on the playlist fragment.
(2) While listening to a playlist, make sure it continues even if the user enters another activity.
(3) When loading wikipage, action buttons appear on top of image "animation".
(4)
(5) When fetching articles from the wiki server by category, set maximum of 20 pages.
(6) When the user's original location changes in fixed radius distance, update the Nearby playlist
    unless it is being played.

MainActivity:
    (1) Navigation View:
        (a) LogIn
        (b) Old recordings
        (c) give Feedback
        (d)
        (e)
        (f)

    (2) Make a Fragment for showing WikiPages that is shared between MainActivity and search page
        activity.


Wikipedia Logic:
    (1) relative - function that lets you see next wiki page based on the page you are in now.
    S.M ^ I don't think we should
    (2) get wiki pages from list of wiki titles.
    S.M ^ already done in Playlist, I agree it should be a Wikipedia function.
    (3) make url returned be one for mobile.
    S.M ^ why does it matter now


TODO s that should be done last (after the rest of the app works):
(1) Make sure the app is working in all landscapes.
(2) Upload titles without wikipages on MainActivity to make it look faster.
(3) Displaying category based playlists now occurs as soon we get their titles.
(4) Anything record related:
    (a) TIPS dialog appear on first instance.
    (b) option for uploading when finished.


Changing Fetching Mechanism?:
    (2) When creating playlists out of selected categories, we:
         (a) GET a list of ALL (around 18k) of the spoken articles.
         (b) We loop (through ALL 18k) to search which are in the wanted category.
         (c) We only return their title, so afterwards we must post another GET request to fetch
             their data.
        This takes A LOT of time. We also don't actually need that many, a playlist shouldn't
        contain that many wikipages.

        I suggest 2 alternatives:
            (1) Location based: (generator=geosearch )
                (a) GET all wikipages nearby (if no location services, fixed place) within a fixed
                    radius.
                (b) Loop through all to search which are in the wanted category, the moment we
                    have around 10-12 pages, we break.
                (c) GET their data.
                (*) Use the text reading engine if necessary.

            (2) Category based: (generator=categorymembers)
                (a) GET all wikipages within that category (may get A LOT).
                (b) If location based:
                        Loop through all to search which are nearby, the moment we
                        have around 10-12 pages, we break.
                    ow:
                        Choose random 10-12 pages.
                (c) GET their data.
                (*) Use the text reading engine if necessary.

Questions:
    (1) Are we suggesting ONLY spoken based categories at the categories activity?
    (2) Why is there a search bar in the ChooseCategoryActivity? it does nothing.
